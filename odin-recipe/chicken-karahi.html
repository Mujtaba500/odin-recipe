    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken karahi is a spicy Pakistani and North Indian dish that is made with bone-in chicken pieces cooked in a wok-style pan with tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and a blend of aromatic spices. The dish gets its name from the karahi, a traditional cooking vessel used to prepare the dish. The dish is often garnished with fresh coriander leaves and served with naan or rice.My favourite</p>
