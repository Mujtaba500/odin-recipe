    <h1>Mutton Biryani</h1>
    <img src="./images/biryani.webp" alt="Delicious-biryani">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mutton biryani is a popular Indian dish made with tender pieces of goat meat cooked in aromatic spices and layered with fragrant, long-grain basmati rice. The meat is usually marinated in a blend of yogurt, ginger, garlic, and spices before being cooked with onions, tomatoes, and green chilies. The rice is also flavored with a mix of whole spices, saffron, and ghee to create a rich, complex flavor profile. This hearty and flavorful dish is often served with raita, a yogurt-based side dish, and papad, a crispy Indian flatbread.</p>
